# 🤖 AI Agent – Overview

## 📌 What is an AI Agent?
An **AI Agent** is a software program that can **perceive**, **reason**, and **act** to achieve specific goals — often autonomously — using **artificial intelligence techniques**.

Think of it like a digital “employee” that can take instructions, gather information, make decisions, and carry out tasks, sometimes without constant human supervision.

## 🔑 Key Characteristics
1. **Autonomy** – Operates independently once given a goal.  
2. **Perception** – Understands its environment through data (text, images, APIs, sensors, etc.).  
3. **Reasoning** – Uses logic, rules, or machine learning to decide actions.  
4. **Action** – Executes tasks, calls APIs, runs code, or interacts with humans/systems.  
5. **Learning** *(optional)* – Improves performance over time with feedback.

## 💡 Examples
- **Customer Support Agent** → Reads your query, fetches answers, and replies.  
- **E-commerce Agent** → Tracks orders, suggests products, and updates inventory.  
- **Developer Agent** → Writes, tests, and deploys code based on requirements.

## 🛠 AI Agents in OpenAI Agents SDK
In OpenAI’s ecosystem, an **AI Agent** is an **LLM-powered system** that can:
- Read your **instructions** (e.g., “Book me a flight to Karachi next Monday”)
- **Call tools** (e.g., flight booking API)
- **Return results** (e.g., booked ticket) without manual user actions.
