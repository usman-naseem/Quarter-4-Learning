## 🧠 How Does Generative AI Work?

Generative AI uses **deep learning techniques** to identify patterns and structures in data. The most common technologies behind it are:

### 🔹 Transformer Models (e.g., GPT)

* Power tools like **ChatGPT**
* Specialized in generating and understanding human-like text

### 🔹 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

* Used for generating **realistic images and videos**
* Composed of two networks: a *Generator* and a *Discriminator*

### 🔹 Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

* Effective in **image, speech, and probabilistic generation tasks**
